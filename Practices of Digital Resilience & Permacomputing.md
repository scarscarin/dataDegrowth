## A symposium rethinking extractive technologies in art, design and society

This one-day event is produced by FIBER in Amsterdam on December 2, 2023. The program offers a series of talks from artists, designers, cultural workers, and activists "who are trying to rethink and rewild technology in response to the endless production of computational devices and big tech infrastructure" ([FIBER, 2023](https://whatis.permacomputing.net/))

### Personal thoughts on permacomputing (pre-event)
The concept of **permacomputing** accepts the disparate alternative practices of computing that are countering big tech — see [de Valk, (2021)](https://doi.org/10.21428/bf6fb269.1e37d8be) — and predicates their co-existence. Taking inspiration from the principles of permaculture, practice and expertise related to permacomputing are often situated within an interconnected web of local contexts, cultures, and techniques.

Permacomputing problematises our **reliance** on digital technology and network infrastructure, as the environmental impact of our digital lives gains prominence. It "encourages the maximising of hardware lifespans" (FIBER, 2023) and it's "exploring good relations with the Earth by learning from ecological systems and experimenting with new ways of ecological-driven computation and aesthetics." (2023).

Aware of the interconnection between digital consumption and hardware production, permacomputing stands as a cultural response to a pressing collective imaginary of climate **collapse**. Permacomputing rejects technology as a solutionist mean to solve the collapse, and  rather explores its use at the service of newly emerged social fabrics; driven by care, community, and ecological awareness.

**Data Degrowth** situates well within **permacomputing**. However, degrowth exists as a proposal that intervenes within a political and economic system. Permacomputing, among others, includes practices that view collapse as the only given variable and navigate ways of existing in post-apocalyptic scenarios. Data degrowth could be situated as the economic branch of permacomputing, where the economy of data is both the subject of research *and* the practice applied.

Also, a digital degrowth is a radical must against an exponentially growing system of collapse.

```
void loop(){
	while (collapse_is_coming == true){
		growth--
	}
}
```

### Introduction & speakers
[Aymeric Mansoux](https://bleu255.com/~aymeric/) opened the symposium with a side note about the ongoing genocide in Gaza. He referred to [fuzzy mirror solidatiry network for Palestine](https://varia.zone/en/librarian-swarm.html) , a collective effort to turn a bibliography on Palestine into a free digital library for public self-education, and the [Translocal Pipas Club](https://constantvzw.org/sponge/s/?u=https://www.constantvzw.org/site/Constant-rejoint-le-Translocal-Pipas-Club.html), a thinking space on these and related issues. Also [No Tech For Apartheid](https://techworkerscoalition.org/no-tech-for-apartheid/) and [@Pipas@post.lurk.org](https://post.lurk.org/@pipas)

Jarl Schulp is the curator and director of FIBER. His practice focuses upon the ever-shifting possibilities and impact of technology on society and the environment. In his research he studies the interactions between technology and ecology, and how technological narratives and visual culture dominate our worldview.

Ola Bonati is a researcher and storyteller who explores cultural connotations of technology, including web 3.0 hype, digital monopolies, platform labour, personal digital habits, and meme vernaculars. She led one of the Permacomputing Labs, the only one I followed.

Lukas Engelhardt is a graphic designer. His whole thing is squat culture (as in housing struggle) and servers.

Brendan Howell is an artist and reluctant(?) engineer. He lives in Berlin, Germany where he teaches digital practices in applied and fine arts institutions.
