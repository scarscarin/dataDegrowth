Below some concepts laid out through a series of interviews by DISNOVATION in [postgrowth.art](postgrowth.art).

### Bio-diversity
we have arrogance that present time is perfect time: species and climate are always going to change. Preserving biodiversity is not preserving current bubbles but rather create the ability for new species to come into being. We should keep sister species that can breed together. We deal with need for adaptive change, preserving the ability to change, flexibility and adaptability to change.
### Downgrading
Timothy Mitchell- Carbon Democracy
Most of the social theories 19th century and 20th (marxism and kantianism) were based on carbon economy which would grow infinitely overtime. We can't be thinking in constant expansion (world overshoot day). "Gobbling up". We are burning through the past. What we need is a shift in the way we think, understanding things can't go on as they are in the moment. Cities retract in size (Detroit 4 or 5 times in size with same costs of infrastructure). Cities we have now and ecosystem are not necessarily going to survive in the future.
How do we think about downsizing? About new forms of social and political interaction?
We make cities and lifestyles as small as necessary, not scaling back but scaling down. Geoffrey West wrote a book about scale, cities are organism scale --> camel stores up some water, we get skinny, cities are living organisms. We need to care for the cities as living organisms.
### Energy and Extremity
Lacking energy and lacking resources is what needs to be addressed in any kind of aerospace project. Why that didn't translate on earth? Paradox! Think systemically about contamination, energy, water, food, models of system that are together.
### Extreme Environments
Extremity comes in vocabulary of biology and ecology in 19th century in relation of spaces and conditions at the edges or outermost dimensions of life. 
Extreme indicates from a technological measure something at the edge. It's a northern western concept that has been applied to biology to questions of: how far can you extend life? How capable is life of adapting to "not normal". Extremity is a charismatic concept, fetishization of pushing life to its limits, dominating life-environment relationship. Extreme environment are not natural, they are a hybrid, emerge in relation to instrumentation and theories being able to measure organismal homeostasis and normality.
### Geo-diversity
Source of biodiversity, as important as biodiversity. Geo begets bio. E.g. we flatten landscape, we make concrete, we move sands, we dredge seamounts when fishing. Turned into flat and standardized. Archaea bacteria were thriving in Paris when people would piss on the side of the street.
### Indigenous Economics
Indigenous societies on Turtle Island were not organized around capitalist principles. The idea of growth as a goal was antithetical to the economic and political organisation. If you are successful is your responsibility to share that wealth. Very rarely would you find a person in power that was also materially wealthy, in order to maintain a position of power they would have to give away that wealth. This is pre-colonial, indigenous. Accumulation was not valued, happiness and health was valued above it.
### Internal Growth
Western knowledge of growth is based on externalization of growth. You have to see it, it has to be measurable externally as an upward trend. This creates a separation between the human internal processes of transformation and exterior forms.
What other knowledges we have to think about internal growth? Or internal transformation as being another valuable focus for our energies. 
### Knowledge Preservation
Indigenous people practice oral tradition and storytelling to teach and carry on knowledge. It facilitates p2p communication and obviates misconceptions or confusions. With advent of digitization and apocalyptic climate change, many indigenous people made the move to share outwards. Also: ceremony is "remember to remember".
### Knowledge Transfer
mentioned above. + indigenous people in turtle island dont perceive time as linear but rather as circular and fluid. Indigenous resistance has been going on since point of contact 1492. Metaphor of waves, with Standing Rock being a big wave impossible to ignore for non-indigenous.
### Negatechnology
Eric Baumer Six silberman - when the implication is not to design
Negation of technology. Field of computing research: what are ways to not have so much computational tech around us. Building systems that intentionally extract themselves over the course of their use. There might be some contexts where there should NOT be a technological intervention. Also field of UNDESIGN, extract systems, reduce number of computational systems that you're interacting with. Negawatt, coined by Amory Lovins, looking at amount of energy saved by a certain activity.
### Regeneration
decolonization means to remove something. In that removal you should make a suggestion of what you replace with, not just take away but instantiating or practicing things that replace the current practice. Model of regeneration. Valuing balance and equity among all living things.
### Kinship
Kinship goes back to the work of Donna Haraway and Adele Clarke (not make kin but population). Old religious idea was chain of being, vertical and hierarchical system. World is rhizomatic, always connected with each other in all ways we can't imagine. Exposome is a microbiome (in stomach) deals with regulating mood and intelligence. We need to recognize new kin. Michelle Serre-Parasite. Living forms living off, living with other living forms. We are parasitic and parasites live within us.
Gestalt switch, how do you induce people to see things differently? You do by telling stories, sensitize them, proposing alternative views.
### The 7th Generation Principle
Links back to indigenous knowledge. It's that anytime someone makes a decision they should think about its impact 7 generations in the future, mindfully with care and responsibility for health and welfare of generations of the future. Wazhazhe or Osage harvest a plant but leave seven, to make sure the plant have regeneration capacities for their seven generations into the future. We extend the 7th generation principle to more than human species.
### Terraforming Earth
We ourselves are made up of all forms of life that change us all the time, eg mithocondria. We terrafom the earth and our life itself adapts and changes. Nature and humans is not binary but "dance of life".
### USA as an Experiment
USA is culturally invoked as a political experiment in democracy or an idea of experimentation. This, however, is allowed through a settler colonial idea occurring after violent removal and killing of indigenous people. The experiment idea allows for a sense of newness, or an attempt to think differently about social organization. Southern California is a gigantic experiment in sustaining mega-populations with resources brought in from the outside. It's a paradox of increasing extremification. Pressures and problems created by powerful elites and industrial elites are leading to experimental responses.

### Collapse Informatics
Interrelates with Computing within Limits. Both call into question the state of industrial civilization, as it creates the conditions for its own failure. They both look for novel forms of computing in ways that affect computing industry and research community. Collapse Informatics focuses on *building systems in the abundant present for use in the future of scarcity*. Computing Within Limits looks at the notion that industrial civilization (and the computing industry situated within) tend to be growth focused. What kind of computing support a degrowth or antigrowth type of direction?
