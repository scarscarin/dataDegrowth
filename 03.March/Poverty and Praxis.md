Raaf from [Unbinare](https://unbina.re/)

Objective of Unbinare is to reduce e-waste by finding ways to reuse electronic devices through reverse engineering.

Lifespan of electronic devices shortening:
- planned obsolescence
- planned artificial retirement of a product by its manufacturer
- strategic use of inability to repair devices
- ever prevalent abandonment of software support for devices that have reached an end life status
- deliberate destruction of unsold products (Amazon)
- 
Increasing lifespan by changing purpose of devices (reverse engineering)

Repurposing: using something that has a particular purpose to perform a task it was not intended to perform

E-Waste: waste that consists of electronic devices. GESP release a document monitoring E-Waste in 2019 7.3kg of E-waste per capita, increasing exponentially. Only 17% was managed in a way that was environmentally sound, 83% is off radar.

Reverse Engineering: discovery and documentation of design secrets. Corporates in electronics industry are entities that put profit before human and environmental wellbeing. Reverse Engineering can be considered a form of corporate espionage. But more correctly, reverse engineering is the reverse of engineering: instead of designing a product from its blueprint, the reverse engineer analyses and documents the functionality of a fully designed product, in order to reach a complete technical documentation of the device. Main drive is curiosity and inquisitiveness, with an anarchist approach (no illegal knowledge, no corporate claim of governmental body)

Poverty or absence of prosperity within social and economic conditions. State of social or economic poverty considered ultimate ill.
