Design for Data Degrowth is a method of design for digital interfaces, tools, and experiences, in which the use of a product deincentivises the production of (more) data.

### On Data Degrowth

In the culture of data and computing, there is a shared belief that every problem can virtually be solved, given an infinite amount of computational power, data, or raw material. Though, when the increasing reliance on such finite resources poses the gravest problem itself, this belief becomes an unfortunate paradox.

Decades of science reports and climate disasters beg us to look at the damage made to the planet by extractive practices of industrial growth. In the meantime, new societal models countering growth are being designed. Degrowth represents maybe the most encompassing school of thought: a political, economic, and social movement on a mission to reduce global consumption and production. Not only as a necessary stop of an otherwise unsustainable economic practice, but, too, as the required premise to a socially and ecologically just society.

Degrowth, simply put, rejects a culture based on consumerism and asks us, consumers, to rethink our own habits and behaviours. The new cultural framework is a proposal of enoughness, one that finds wellbeing, freedom, and beauty in living with limits.

Data Degrowth is the practice of such a framework within our digital realm. For a renewed set of values where less data is more, where storage limits are approached with care, and computational resources with fear and respect. In short, Data Degrowth is a proposition to strengthen our understanding of the relationship between planetary resources and our own data habits.

### Principles of Data Degrowth

Data Degrowth questions the designs through which we interface with data, translating principles of Degrowth into design inquiries. Design deals already with such concepts as "constraints" or "user agency". Here, I list some of the (ongoing) principles of designing for Degrowth.
#### Design for Enoughness
Enoughness can be described as the experience of inherent contentment, as opposed to a culture of "moreness". In fact, "more" of a resource does not directly equate to a better result, a simple example being watering a plant. In Data Degrowth, enoughness translates to designs that water *just enough*. Where the data produced, and their impact, is minimal to the *enough*, balancing functionality of a product to its energy and resources cost.

**Examples**: Small Language Models
#### Design for Frugality
#### Design for Use with Limits
#### Design for Autonomy
#### Design for Conviviality
#### Design for Commoning
