Design for Data Degrowth is a method of design for digital interfaces, tools, and experiences, in which the use of a product deincentivises the production of (more) data.

### On Data Degrowth
In the culture of data and computing, there is a shared belief that virtually every problem can be solved, given an infinite amount of computational power, data, or raw material. However, when the increasing reliance on such finite resources poses the gravest problem itself, this belief becomes a paradox.

Decades of science reports and climate disasters beg us to look at the damage made to the planet by extractive practices of industrial growth. In the meantime, new societal models countering growth are being designed. Degrowth represents maybe the most encompassing school of thought: a political, economic, and social movement on a mission to reduce global consumption and production. Not only as a necessary stop of an otherwise unsustainable economic practice, but, too, as the required premise to a socially and ecologically just society.

Degrowth, in simple, rejects a culture based on consumerism and asks us, consumers, to rethink our own habits and behaviours. The new cultural framework is a proposal of enoughness, one that finds wellbeing, freedom, and beauty in living with limits.

	In the technology sector, the capitalistic promise of infinite economic growth is locked tight to Gordon Mooreâ€™s observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every year while its costs are halved. It describes the rapid growth in computational power over decades. Similar dynamics emerge in the global demand for data storage, and it seems that both are interlinked. The faster you can process data, the bigger your appetite for it. Conversely, the more data becomes available, the more computational power is required for storage and processing. The industry creates incentives for users not only to produce content but also to share and back it up, meaning, in fact, to endlessly duplicate and never delete. The tech industry labels continuous storage as the solution to our storage problem, but it is, in fact, creating it instead. The more Kilo, Mega, Giga, Tera, Peta or Exa, the less necessity we feel to control our digital clutter. Clutter that manifests itself as overly full inboxes with unanswered e-mails, deserted social media accounts we never actually visit anymore, long-forgotten download files clogging disk space and abandoned Dropbox folders storing identical data on multiple devices.

Data Degrowth is the practice of such a framework within our digital realm. For a renewed set of values where less data is more, where storage limits are approached with care, and computational resources with fear and respect. In short, Data Degrowth is a proposition to strengthen our understanding of the relationship between planetary resources and our own data habits.

### Values of Data Degrowth
#### Enoughness
The proposal of Degrowth comes with a set of values, derived from pre-existing practices and ethics, often pre-dating industrial ages. One of the most important is the practice of enoughness. When is a commodity just enough? And at what size, instead, does it become redundant, or even unsustainable. The concept of enoughness links, but is absolutely not restrained to, the concept of minimalism, which itself owes a lot to Eastern practices of Buddhism and Francescanesimo. A minimalist lifestyle, by definition, minimises the amount of belongings to the *necessary*, but *enough* exists anywhere above *as little as possible* and below *too much*. A measure that anyone who watered plants before must be familiar with.

In Data Degrowth, enoughness translates to designs that water *just enough*. Where the data produced, and their impact, is minimal to the *enough*, balancing functionality to the energy and resources cost.
