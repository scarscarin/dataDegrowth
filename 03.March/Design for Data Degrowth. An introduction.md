Design for Data Degrowth is a method of design for digital interfaces, tools, and experiences, in which the use of a product de-incentivises the production of (more) data.

### On Data Degrowth

In the technological sector, there is a shared belief that every problem can virtually be solved, given an infinite amount of computational power, data, or raw material. The increasing reliance on such finite resources, though, now poses the gravest problem itself. This belief is becoming a paradox: growing (more) data is no longer sustainable. It never was. But the myth of data growth as the only solution available makes this practice seem irreplaceable.

Decades of science reports and climate disasters beg us to look at the damage made to the planet by extractive practices of industrial growth. In the meantime, new societal models countering growth are being formulated. Degrowth represents maybe the most encompassing school of thought: a political, economic, and social movement on a mission to reduce global consumption and production. Not only as a necessary stop of an otherwise unsustainable economic practice, but, too, as the required premise to a socially and ecologically just society.

Degrowth, simply put, rejects a culture based on consumerism and imagines a society beyond GDP. In this context, Degrowth asks us, consumers, to rethink our own habits and behaviours. The new cultural framework is a proposal of enoughness: one that finds wellbeing, freedom, and beauty in living with limits.

Data Degrowth is the practice of such a framework within our digital realm. For a renewed set of values where less data is more. Where storage limits are approached with care, and computational resources with fear and respect. In short, Data Degrowth is a proposition to strengthen our understanding of the relationship between planetary resources and our own data habits.

### Principles of Data Degrowth

Data Degrowth questions the designs through which we interface with data, and translates principles of Degrowth into a new framework of thinking. Needless to say, design historically deals with concepts of "constraints" or "efficiency". Here, these are revisited through a political and ecological lens, with a narrow focus on data interfaces. This is to formulate new (ongoing) principles of designing for Data Degrowth.
#### Design for Enoughness
Enoughness can be described as the experience of inherent contentment, as opposed to a culture of "moreness". In fact, "more" of a resource does not directly equate to a better result. 

In nature, vegetation is "designed" to thrive with just enough resources. A right amount of water makes a plant grow strong, whereas too much rain results in floods and destruction. Then again, a plant might need different intakes of water at different phases of its life, or throughout different seasons, species, ecosystems. Enoughness is never a standard, but rather a locally situated balance of satisfaction and tolerance.

An example of design that carries this principle is the *automatic faucet*: a tap equipped with a proximity sensor and a mechanism that opens its valve *only* in presence of the user's hands. Easy to spot in a public hospital, the *automatic facet* provides *enough* water at the user's will, reducing water waste and the spread of disease-causing microbes. In design terms, the sink affords rinsing hands. And the resources used for this are never greater than the tool's affordance.

In Data Degrowth, enoughness translates to designs that water *just enough*. Where the data produced, and their impact, is minimal to the necessary amount, satisfying an affordance like storing, moving, or producing data, but without overkill.
