Design for Data Degrowth is a method of design for digital interfaces, tools, and experiences, in which the use of a product deincentivises the production of (more) data.

### On Data Degrowth

In the technological sector, there is a shared belief that every problem can virtually be solved, given an infinite amount of computational power, data, or raw material. The increasing reliance on such finite resources, though, now poses the gravest problem itself. This belief is becoming a paradox: growing (more) data is no longer sustainable. It never was. But the myth of data growth, with its heavy cultural power, makes this practice seem irreplaceable.

Decades of science reports and climate disasters beg us to look at the damage made to the planet by extractive practices of industrial growth. In the meantime, new societal models countering growth are being formulated. Degrowth represents maybe the most encompassing school of thought: a political, economic, and social movement on a mission to reduce global consumption and production. Not only as a necessary stop of an otherwise unsustainable economic practice, but, too, as the required premise to a socially and ecologically just society.

Degrowth, simply put, rejects a culture based on consumerism and imagines a society without GDP. In this context, Degrowth asks us, consumers, to rethink our own habits and behaviours. The new cultural framework is a proposal of enoughness, one that finds wellbeing, freedom, and beauty in living with limits.

Data Degrowth is the practice of such a framework within our digital realm. For a renewed set of values where less data is more, where storage limits are approached with care, and computational resources with fear and respect. In short, Data Degrowth is a proposition to strengthen our understanding of the relationship between planetary resources and our own data habits.

### Principles of Data Degrowth

Data Degrowth questions the designs through which we interface with data, and translates principles of Degrowth into a new framework of thinking. Needless to say, design historically deals with such concepts as "constraints" or "user agency". Here, these are revisited through a political and ecological lens, with a narrow focus on data interfaces, to formulate new (ongoing) principles of designing for Data Degrowth.
#### Design for Enoughness
Enoughness can be described as the experience of inherent contentment, as opposed to a culture of "moreness". In fact, "more" of a resource does not directly equate to a better result, a simple example being watering a plant. In Data Degrowth, enoughness translates to designs that water *just enough*. Where the data produced, and their impact, is minimal to the *enough*, balancing functionality of a product to its energy and resources cost.
