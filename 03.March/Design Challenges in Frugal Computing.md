*A. Cloud computing*
Saving energy during operation, optimising for energy consumption, more energy efficient software on all layers; better use of renewables through smarter scheduling. Increasing the useful life, e.g. reliability monitoring and early-warning systems, degradation-aware operation

*B. Ultra-HD video & VR/AR*
Roll-out could lead to order of magnitude increases in video/3D traffic. To mitigate this, we need better compression (e.g. tailored, AI), local rendering (e.g. using FPGAs), better caching, energy-efficient edge computing.

*C. IoT*
The projected growth in IoT devices is huge, resulting in huge increase in network traffic as well as in emissions from production. To mitigate this, we need to increase the device lifespan; reducing energy consumption helps primarily with this; and use edge computing to reduce network traffic.

*D. Mobile devices*
The projected growth in mobile devices is still very large, and current lifespans much too short. We mainly need longer-term software support, so better software engineering practices, in particular relating to security. Apps should be designed to minimise full system energy consumption; *user interfaces should nudge users towards energy efficient behaviour.*
