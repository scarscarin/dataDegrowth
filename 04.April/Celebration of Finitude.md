Elaborates on design visions for computing, by attending to values expressed in ideals around post industrial ways of living.

Three themes:
- embrace possibilities within limits
- resist fantasies of unlimited power
- welcoming complexity as an inherent feature of the living

Katherine Hayles in "*how we became posthuman*":
"*my dream is a version of the posthuman that embraces the possibilities of information technologies without being seduced by fantasies of unlimited power and disembodied immortality, that recognizes and celebrates finitude as a condition of human being, and that understands human life is embedded in a material world of great complexity, one on which we depend for our continued survival*"

Nigel Cross introduces the concept of Post-Industrial Design in 1981 as aiming towards a "*sane, humane, ecological (SHE) vision*" instead of the previous "*hyper expansionist (HE) vision*" of a future society.

Arts and Crafts movement resisted the industrial design project, as it developed and evolved since late 1800's. Central to this movement is an appreciation of traditional crafts as *precious*, compared to industrial manufacturing and labour.

**Embracing Possibilities within limits**
Philosophy of Wabi-Sabi: "nothing lasts, notion is finished, and nothing is perfect."

Idea of embracing the limitations of current technology in order to fully explore its potential. This relates to bricolage, in which available materials, tools, and resources are used in a creative dialogue to achieve a desired outcome.

Interaction design relies heavily on technological advancements and computational materials, such as circuit boards, software systems, and peripherals and therefore, a working knowledge of these technologies and their expressions is essential to create successful user experiences.

Acknowledging the limitations of current technology also fosters a sense of honesty in design, recognizing that artefacts will break and may need updates.

In computing, impermanence is evident in the decay and fragility of physical materials. We all experience full disk space, declining battery life, broken screens, and malfunctioning hardware.

Bell et. al. [5] suggests growing interactive designs using biomaterials and recovering internal previous metals and components before composting the design.

Designs that build on and emphasise material craftsmanship, both in the design of the systems, but also in practices of maintenance, repair, upgrading or recycling of these designs.

Computer systems are driven by electrical power and are essentially shaping electrical currents.

A line of work that aims to address material over-use (free of charge services like GPT and ad-based social media) is self-sustainable interactions (solar powered website).

Designs that value temporality, from commercial successes like Snapchat, to a range of research explorations.
