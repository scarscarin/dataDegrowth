What is the research that's not been done for X reasons?
officially islamic countries u dont do research into darwinism
impact of industry > cs research is done into ai because thats where money is > limits and degrowth was going back to "you can have this" but elephant in the room is market
we need to address market and economic behavior

how can programming languages > global or local scale > languages that make it more complicated to deal with the cloud

lot of research is "how efficient is programming language" > rebound effect jevox paradox

firewall assumes hostile behavior

transition from one word to the other (one is cloud, and the other?)
traditional ones and yours? do you want to reset?

cloud means two things > decouple (remote storage and remote computing)

metaphors dont change the world but the way we engage with it

the job of computer scientists is to make faster and unlimited memory

something fun about people like to make things better > prize for which team is more sustainable > give them a different kind of gold medal > new metric?

what is the abs min computer we can have for people that its not absolute waste

categorize words in different parti, value parameters etc

value sensitive design doesnt work only on computer > broad values and how does it look like for designers? stakeholders

ivan ilich > what kind of dependencies, what kind of replacements? could allow you to be specific

here's the number of ways in which tools are not convivial > create dependencies / polarization etc. there are some tools who match all these things and some tools who dont, what is convivial? he was thinking of concrete, plastic but it applies to computer (think broadly of wider topics) HERE"S A FRAMEWORK TO THINK SBOUT THINGS

systematizing conviviality? give an example in your design practice, examples inspire other peoples and discipline

Advice is stay focused!

what is it that we want and what is it that we need?

difference between survival and expansion

what is needed is preservation of language, how do you do it? fast and convenient approach which is LLM > WHAT IS IT REPLACING?

VALUE SENSITIVE DESIGN

https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_convivialit%C3%A0

sacrifice expansionism speed

example could be a workshop, non-designers come to workshop > what would be a degrowth practice or tool
