### Preface
Aim of the book is to contribute to post-capitalist dialogue. After introducing the techno-economic paradigm shifts theory, which sees capitalism as a creative destruction process, the author draws four scenarios: netarchical capitalism, distributed capitalism, resilient communities and global Commons. The last two reside in the hypothetical model of mature peer production under civic dominance (though I'm not sure what the author means by "mature peer production"). Author concludes the book with transition proposals toward a Commons-based economy and society.

### Capitalism as a Creative Destruction System
Author draws from other literature on arguments of Capitalism as a Creative Destruction System. Techno-economic paradigm shifts (TEPS) and their phases are explained.

### Three Competing Value Models
Author argues that labour value and proprietary forms of knowledge, originating from the classic capitalist economy, specially from its industrial phase, is declining. Author anticipates there are two more competing value models, one reaching dominance and one emerging.

### P2P Infrastructures
P2P infrastructures allow for permission-less interlinking of human co-operators and their technological aids.

Four scenarios originating from p2p infrastructures are NC, DC, RC, and GC (mentioned in preface).
