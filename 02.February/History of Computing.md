## Intro
- What is the story we tell ourselves on historical thread of computing? What is the aerial view? The string?
- Brief outline / arc of the narrative, how it's constructed
- is it sustainable? can it absorb  new development?
## What is the Grand Narrative
- Quipu: knotted chords (ancestral) used by Incas up until 1600-1700
- Tally Stick: 8000 years old until 1826 (counterfoil and stockholders)
- Computing sees its history in counting numbers and systems: manual calculation
- Soroban
- Schotty
- Napier's bones (1617)
- Slide Rules until 1970s (electronic pocket calculators)
- Logarithms (1704)
## Mechanical Calculators
- Pascaline (1642)
- Thomas de Colmar Arithmometer. Take up of this product was slow
- Johann Muller's Universal Calculator, 1784
- Algorithm is only partially incorporated: they are manual, they require human intervention for the algorithm to proceed.
## Determinism
- Telling a story in a linear way has perhaps an implication that there is a causal connection between events.
- Often needs were fictional: pre-existing need or critical need but often they are created for rhetorical or political purposes. See Babbage's machine utilitarian motive (eliminate errors in tables) and actual motive (theoretical potential).
- Not all innovation is a satisfactory response to a declared need.
- Seeing each innovation as a response to a pre-existing need eliminates the need for further inquiry
- Serial narrative there's a tendency to remove parallel development. In music we can follow multiple voices, harmonic sounds. 
- Language seems to need to be serialised. You read a book chapter by chapter. Medium affects seriality.
- The linear narrative reflect a presumption of technological determinism: does history make machine or machine make history?
## River Diagram
- Material culture
- river diagram is to read events in non linear way
- Comptator, Chain Adder, 1910
- 1840-1930 there's a gap
- information management and automated computing are two different fields that intertwine non-linearly
- Curta Calculator, 1948
- Russian Schotty (abacus)
- functionally distinct is physically distinct (telephone vs fax machine. telegraph vs tubular)
- 70s submicron geometry (transistors) destroy distinction of categories. Multiple functions in a compound device
- silicon revolution defied conventional categories
- convergence meant death of classes ergo death of grand narrative
## Core ideas
- Mechanical process
- Digital Logic
- Algorithm
- Systems architecture
- Software and universality
- Internal stored program
## Mechanical Process
- 1821 he had his epiphany
- "I wish these calculations were executed by steam" captures the extension of industrial metaphor to mental activity
- Difference Engine
- Lady Byron wrote in 1833 she saw a thinking machine
- "replaced the marvellous pulp and fibre of brain with brass and still"
- may produce same outcome as thinking process but wasn't doing what brains do
- mechanical is unthinking (Turing, Neumann)
- mechanical doesn't presume higher consciousness
- industrialization of thought is reflected in contemporary language
	- real manufacturing of numbers
	- mechanical fabrication of tables
## Digital Logic
- decimal
- Difference Engine is digital because Babbage's control mechanisms make them so
- Calculating Wheels
- Machine jams or breaks but never deceives
## Calculation to Computation
- difference engine is calculator (you couldn't alter)
- general purposes computation allows to alter rules by which the information is manipulated
- Analytical Engine marks the step from calculation to GPC
- One step is digital automation, next step is to generalise it
- Punched Cards for Analytical Engine
- Algorithms has been transferred to the operation cards
- *Analytical Engine, Plan 25, 1840*
- Jacquard Loom, punched cards
- Cultural significance & technical significance: aesthetic subtlety was not the exclusive province of the human agent. Translucency of the drapes and subtle shading was used in attempt of receiving acceptance from industrial manufacture.
- Loom: weave textile based on a punch card design. Product is specific about the "software" in the cards. Idea of generic universality
- functional specific are outside the machine

## Modern Computing
- what is music but numbers closed in sound
- how do we get from mathematical machine to GPC: realisation that numbers represent entities other than quantity
- **power of computing comes from representational power of number**
- Ada Lovelace, 1843 publishes a sketch of analytical engine
- even thought the grammar of the rule is not the same as the grammar of the phenomena that is being modelled it does not really matter
- you have opportunity of simulation and modelling
