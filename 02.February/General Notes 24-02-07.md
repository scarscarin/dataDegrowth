After a bunch of degrowth readings, I'm realizing that post-growth might be a more accurate term, as it doesn't measure its success in metrics of growth but rather constructs an alternative approach to economics that goes beyond growth. Degrowth, however, is a strong word. It certainly states the urgency of "going against growth" more urgently than a banal "post-".

Also, before going further into technical readings, I should get an understanding and general literacy on topics like energy, resources, materials, and emissions.

What are questions that are hot at this phase of my research?
- what would be my table of contents? As in what does it boil down to when I categorize my research and write it
- what is the research question and conclusion I want to achieve? I'm tackling the topic of Data Degrowth but what about it? 
	- descriptive question (*what*? what factors determine a scenario - qualitative assessment, analyze descriptively, don't need data) or 
	- explanatory questions (*why*? variables that can be tested with indicators, determining a relationship between independent variable – eg unemployment – and its effect on the outcome – eg ethnic tensions, higher unrest etc)
	I feel like my question would mostly fall into descriptive: what is Data Degrowth? What are the factors that make Data Degrowth. Permacomputing makes a case for an already existing field. Where does Data Degrowth already exist? It certainly exist within the "parent" field of permacomputing. I should define its specificity.
	If I talk about the explanatory question, it would be something that refers to practitioners – eg how does Data Degrowth affect design. Look at design history of constraints, limits, and other keywords
	- what do I do with these keywords?
		- constraints / limits
		- growth / degrowth / postgrowth / antigrowth
		- Moore's law / exponential functions
		- decay / decompose / remove oneself
		- declutter / trashing / cleaning / negating
		- focusing / attending / narrowing down to
		- slowness
		- long-term / 7th gen
		- regeneration / healing (addiction)
		- extremes / collapse / apocalypse / speculative
		- abundance what is abundant? / scarcity (list out different kind of materials) what is scarce?
		- resistance
		- sacrifice / what do you gain on the other side?
		- infinity / minimality / unit
	
	- target audience: I don't want to make yet another effort that only resonates within a filter bubble. However, it is not my voice who should make the effort to reach out to wider public. But I can use my energy to construct a literacy around data degrowth and inform people that mediate knowledge (that is artists, designers, researchers, writers, etc). My target, therefore, or at least the very first target of my research, is makers / practitioners that are also data consumers / producers and that are open to hear alternative approaches to growth. Here's hoping that household, end-users, can be addressed. Could I pivot the writing around a study case that can be involved in the process? Can I make my dad defy algorithms? Can my grandma resist algo-surveillance?
		Is the point of data degrowth, actually, defying algorithms? what other ways than resistance exist. What are propositions that do not defy algorithms?
		Thinking about it. Data as a system is really big. What are the most impactful types of data? What are the sectors in which data plays big role? We should maybe situate the discussion about data degrowth within a discourse of AI and ML datasets. There we can expose systems of extraction and exploitation. How does extraction of data and exploitation of data link with emissions?

Thinking...

What are the kind of problems and solutions given by my filter bubble?
- **critical design**: what design can't do? fine a se stesso, che è un bene e un male. Critical Design works well in self-consciously regulating itself and being critical of itself in improving. I can address this to inform my research: data degrowth is a form of criticism towards designs of data production and data consumption, as well as a criticism towards design without constraints, Moore law's design, unlimited design.
- **media art**: impractical, requires tech literacy, non-distributable ergo inaccessible. Has some sort of magic to it. Makes the discovery of novel and alternative mechanics a tool that doesn't require expensive material. Code is simulation. Media art is simulated realities. Simulation gives a great deal of storytelling. Media art can facilitate the medium through which the story of data degrowth is told. How to formalise and give life to new aesthetics *and* mechanics?
- **ecological activism**: struggles to realize itself when playing by the rules / violent-nonviolent discourse. To what extent of radicalism "should" we act. However, inspiring and very clever self-organisation. Codes and systems of collective behavior. This could inform the way data degrowth practices itself as a community. Away from academic authority, open to shared editors, libraries, but also "bubbles", "demos", "regen sessions". Can climate activism inform digital activism? There's a spirituality and physicality to climate activism that does not exist in digital activism bubbles. Can we treat the digital, the data, as a resource of collective interest?

How did we get here from a tiny MOSFET?!

Political and cultural history of computing. How did we come to digital electronic computers? Through what academic needs? Through what military needs? Through what business and commerce needs? How to begin understanding computing history in relation to data history?

Parallel research? I'm interested in the cultural history of data production and extraction in parallel with the history of the tools that extremified data production and extraction beyond sustainability.

Moore's law moore's law moore's law

What would be my study case? What can be my poetic intervention to the research? How do I make this attractive and relatable to a community of immediate peers? How do I make it authentic?

***Relatability***. How do climate activist talk about climate issue trying to be relatable? Talking about it as a collective issue. Applying radical disobedience. Appearing as good Christians while trying to subvert the current state of things.

Am I making an economic approach to design? Can design be treated as an economic system? with scarce resources, feedback loops, etc.

ecological and digital activism are two faces of similar issue of justice. While ecological activism, in particular degrowth, counters growth and its measure through GDP, digital activism counters a culture that relies on technological solutions for human social problems, Moore's law is central to the technological futurism / solutionism (explore this). Degrowth : GDP = Detech : Moore's Law

What does it mean to detech? detach? detechnologize? de technique? it means decreasing the reliance on technological solutions and practicing solutions that are not bound to techno but to social fabrics and infrastructures. Healthy growth *and* healthy tech. Infinite growth infinite scroll.

what i mean by design consequences? consequences are cause-effect implications of data degrowth practices on design. What are the core elements of design? here im focusing on user-centered or human centered design, interaction design, and product design, interface design, web design, network design, algorithm design? how does data degrowth deploys onto these design fields?

### Questions for Pierre
I need input on what material to read to explore further history of data prod-extraction in parallel to history of computing tools that extremified data culture beyond sustainability.

I need a response to my set target audience: practitioners or mediators of knowledge that are active data prod-consumers *and* open to explore alternative approaches to growth.

I find that my understanding of degrowth is now bigger than what it initially meant. But want to focus on the political economy sides of it, less interested in technicals, tho i should train my energy literacy. Can the economic aspects be translated to design features? eg scarcity, material, energy, etc

Research goal set: synthesising an atlas of practices of data degrowth, while building a vocabulary of the topic (similar to permacomputing paper) *then* offering a critical commentary into the design consequences, with focus on tools for alternative data-computing approaches, formalizing a novel form of "eco-digital" activism.
