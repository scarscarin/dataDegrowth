Design for Data Degrowth is a method of design for digital interfaces, tools, and experiences, in which the use of a product deincentivises the consumption or production of (more) data.

### On Data Degrowth
In the culture of data and computing, one finds a certain belief that every problem can be solved, given an infinite amount of computational power, data, or raw material. However, when the increasing reliance on such finite resources poses a grave problem itself, the belief becomes a paradox.

Decades of science reports and climate disasters beg us to look at the damage made to the planet by extractive practices of industrial growth. In the meantime, new societal models countering these practices are being designed. Degrowth represents maybe the most encompassing school of thought: a political, economic, and social movement on a mission to reduce global consumption and production. Not only as a necessary stop of an otherwise unsustainable economic practice, but, too, as the required premise to a socially and ecologically just society.

Degrowth, basically, rejects a culture based on consumerism and begs us, consumers, to rethink our own habits and behaviours. The new cultural framework is a proposal of enoughness, one that finds wellbeing, freedom, and beauty in living with limits.

Data Degrowth is the practice of such a framework within our digital realm. For a renewed set of values where less data is more, where storage limits are approached with care, and computational resources with fear and respect. In short, Data Degrowth is a proposition to strengthen our understanding of the relationship between planetary resources and our own data habits.

### Values of Data Degrowth
#### Enoughness
The proposal of Degrowth comes with a set of values, derived from pre-existing practices and ethics, often pre-dating industrial ages. One of the most important is the practice of enoughness. When is a commodity just enough? And at what size, instead, does it become redundant, or even unsustainable. The concept of enoughness links, but is absolutely not restrained to, the concept of minimalism, which itself owes a lot to Eastern practices of Buddhism and Francescanesimo. A minimalist lifestyle, by definition, minimises the amount of belongings to the *necessary*, but *enough* exists anywhere above *as little as possible* and below *too much*. A measure that anyone who watered plants before must be familiar with.

In Data Degrowth, enoughness translates to designs that water *just enough*. Where the data produced, and their impact, is minimal to the *enough*, balancing functionality to the energy and resources cost.
