# What is Data Degrowth?

Design for Data Degrowth is a method of design for digital interfaces, tools, and experiences, in which the production of (more) data is disincentivised.

Data Degrowth begins as an artistic research studying the practice of *degrowing data* in terms of aesthetics, poetics, and cultural impact. In practice, Data Degrowth continues as a design-thinking framework for activities using data that are limited in size, geography, or time. 

The closest field of research would be [Permacomputing]([permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/)) or [Computing Within Limits](https://computingwithinlimits.org/): both these communities are dedicated to reduce the environmental impact of computing technologies. Data Degrowth narrows down the question to the impact that degrowth principles can have in data culture. In particular, looking at existing design proposals that discourage the consumption of (more) data.
# What is wrong with Computing?

In the technological sector, there is a shared belief that every problem can virtually be solved, given an infinite amount of computational power, data, or raw material. The increasing reliance on these finite resources, though, now poses the gravest problem itself. The belief is becoming a paradox: growing (more) data is no longer sustainable. It never was. But the myth of data growth as the only possible solution makes this practice seem irreplaceable.

# # What is Degrowth?

Decades of science reports and climate disasters begged us to look at the damage the planet suffered from the extractive practices of industrial growth. In the meantime, political ecologists and climate activists are formulating new societal models countering growth. Degrowth represents maybe the most encompassing school of thought: a political, economic, and social movement aiming to reduce global consumption and production. Not only to stop an otherwise unsustainable economic practice, but, too, as the required premise to social and ecological justice.

Degrowth, simply put, rejects a culture based on overconsumption and imagines a society beyond GDP. In this context, Degrowth asks us, consumers, to rethink our own habits and behaviours. The new cultural framework is a proposal of enoughness: one that finds wellbeing, freedom, and beauty in living with limits.

Data Degrowth is the rehearsal of this framework in our digital realm. For a renewed set of values where less data is more. Where storage limits are approached with care, and computational resources with fear and respect. In short, Data Degrowth is a proposition to strengthen our understanding of the relationship between planetary resources and our own data habits.
