## Data Rabbit Hole
- !! information
- !! "new oil of digital economy"
- symbols / interpreted formally
- collection
- organized into structures
- may be used as variables in a computational process
- measurement / observation / query / analysis
- in-situ / field data
- smallest units of factual information
- "as a general concept, refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing"
- !! big data (what is small data?)
- DIKW pyramid
- data is more than knowledge
- The Database: an aesthetic of dignity
- metadata

### Data is the new oil
data is valuable
good data beats opinion

### Weapons of Math Destruction
"math was able to combine with technology to multiply the chaos and misfortune, adding efficiency and scale to systems that I now recognized as flawed".
"in the wake of the crisis, new mathematical techniques were hotter than ever, and expanding into still more domains."
"harmful kinds of models: Weapons of Math Destruction, or WMDs for short."
"At Big Data companies like Google, by contrast, researchers run constant tests and monitor thousands of variables."
"Equally important, statistical systems require feedbackâ€”something to tell them when they're off track."
"The model itself is a black box, its contents a fiercely guarded corporate secret"
"How do you justify evaluating people by a measure for which you are unable to provide explanation? The nature of WMDs is that the analysis is outsourced to coders and statisticians. And as a rule, they let the machines to the talking"
"evaluation algorithms are a powerful tool for behavioural modification."
"You cannot appeal to a WMD. They do not listen"
"Human victims of WMDs are held to a far higher standard of evidence than the algorithms themselves"
"WMD are at the heart of the raging data economy"
"receiving end of the transaction"
"feedback and incentive of data scientists is money"
"think of the astounding scale, and ignore the imperfections"

In the intro of WMD by Cathy O'Neil there are some concepts and notions I could use to reflect on Data Degrowth, or rather confirming Data Degrowth's urgency. One that stands out is the idea that the astounding scale of an algorithm could supersede imperfections.

Another concept to nurture is the black box. What is black-boxing role in building a practice of data degrowth?

moneyball are fair models cause theyre transparent: everyone has access to the stats and can understand more or less how they're interpreted.

Scalability of an WMD model has the capacity to turn "local nuisances into tsunami forces". A model of small scale, that works with local variables and situated systems, can become damaging at bigger scale. From this, I gather that the capacity of a model to grow exponentially depends on the adaptability of a model to the variants and exceptions. Can the model bend to exceptions and variations? If the dataset grows, is the model still efficient? And if the model is still efficient, does the end goal "efficiency" still responds to the correct question? Is efficiency what we need? Can there be a universal model anyway? The urgency of critiquing this toxic concept of scalability, and contrasting its consequences, is an urgency that responds directly to data degrowth practices. How do we limit ourselves to small scale, situated, familiar models? A small model means it's, too, closely understandable as humans. If my model harms someone in my family or neighbourhood, I am incentivised to change it. If my model harms someone I don't know I probably couldn't care less. How do we care? How do we rebuild an understanding of scalability?

I have to get back at cheapness. "Who wouldn't want a cheap solution like this?" where *cheap* means *efficient*, *cost-effective*, or anyway oriented to a better cost-resource ratio. DD suggests to rethink *cost* and expand our understanding of *resource*. Can we measure cost as the lack of our attention, solidarity, and wellbeing? Is that more or less important than 2 pounds of gold? Is our time on Earth a resource? Or rather, the sustainability of system Gaia, including humans? Can we "resource-ify" spiritual and intellectual aspects of our lives? Attentional commons.

Collateral damage!!

In regards to Facebook "voter megaphone": I guess it's easy to fall into the idea that Facebook (or Instagram/TikTok etc) are big scale human laboratory, therefore providing bigger amount of data to tweak a model. However, I'd like to dive deeper into why the data provided about a digital consumer in a digital medium must not be able to reflect an accurate depiction. Also, the data is situated in a big scale feedback loop of influence and action.
