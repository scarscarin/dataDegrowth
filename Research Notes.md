Big issue is when you make a web browser

UXN?

Linux

limits as something positive rather than negative
limitations as something good rather than bad? everything infintely?

Arte Povera

guides?

90% accuracy vs 97% accuracy

when someone engages with my project? background knowledge and family of action

material culture of computing

dependency? you use adobe but your stuck in terms and conditions > dependency can be positive / act of care or solidarity

put down one or two pages: 
- here's the reason why we have this problem, offloading inv infrastr data center bla bla jevons
- how do we address this: practices, data degrowth what it means
- a blog post

what why how

how far do we need to go? we should do less instead of more. how much less? 

**more about the direction than amplitude**

do you wanna play on easy mode, mid mode, hard mode

main conclusion was opening up different ways of thinking: here's this thing called scale (up out down), scale is a business proposal. Shifting the perspective on the word. What are the other words that we use in computing? What are the metaphors? How do we change configurations?

Environment of the software run, are there a=other ways we can look at it, dirty energy environment?

Being able to name things and being able to see or engage with what it is that you're working on. Sysadmin says "back in the day when u had a server it was a new ship blablabla" now u have an aws and it's just numbers. Abstraction vs concrete and leaning more towards the concrete.

Web development course, bit of react, easy path> this is glitch. Hard path> open up your cloud provider (rent a machine, here's terminal, ssh etc). Versal. Taking more time to teach the materiality.

can u actually teach introductory programming with deep embedded programming systems, teaching C (deal with memory) you know what is being hidden.

jquery, then we decided to teach js, then jquery cause at least they know what is under.

open discussion on free software adobe!

catchy introduction

where does our food comes from, clothes, 

write a blog post, landing page of data degrowth
